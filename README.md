# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project was to present the UFO sighting data in a way that is interactive and convenient for audiences. 

## Results: 
- The page begins with an introductory statement about UFOs and the UFO sighting data. <br><br> <img width="1575" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 10 48 28 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199828/132872678-95b724c2-5be2-4125-ad18-190050b32a66.png">
- To use the webpage, all users have to do is fill out the input fields for the search criteria: data, city, country, state, and shape. The searches will be filtered real-time. That is to say, the users do not have to push any "Filter" button, for example. <br><br> <img width="1557" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 10 49 25 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199828/132872846-ed332596-7b63-46c7-a048-b59afe612c96.png">
- To refresh the search and clear the filters, they click on the "UFO Sightings" navigation bar button on the top left.  <br><br> <img width="130" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 10 49 54 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10199828/132872924-0f437ba3-4026-4af3-819c-e720791f0cff.png">

## Summary: 
- One drawbacks of this design is that the input fields are case-senstive. For example, typing in "fresno" yields result, but "Fresno" doesn't. 
- Some recommendations to further improve the design:
  - Make the input fields non-case sensitive, so complete data is presented for each input. 
  - The "UFO Sightings" button is unclear, so we should create a refresh or clear filters button.
  - Update the HTML/CSS design to look more modern and interesting.
